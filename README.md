The codes in this repository demonstrates concepts and use case of linear classifier, specifically perceptron algorithm, average perceptron and one of perceptron's variation, Pegasos algorithm.\
It starts with implementing the necessary unit of the algorithm, hinge loss (first for a single data point and then for the wholde datasets), parameters update (also first single data point and then the whole datasets).\
In the end, the whole project checks a dataset consisting of website reviews and use the best performing algorithms among perceptron, average perceptron and Pegasos to do a sentiment analysis or classification.\
Namely, whether the review is positive or negative.
Please note, this project is one of the homework of MIT online course MITx 6.86x. So you should not simply copy the code and submit it as your own answer if you are also taking this course.

The codes in this repository demonstrates concepts and use case of linear classifier, specifically perceptron algorithm, average perceptron and one of perceptron's variation, Pegasos algorithm.\
\
It starts with implementing the necessary unit of the algorithm, hinge loss (first for a single data point and then for the wholde datasets), parameters update (also first single data point and then the whole datasets).\
\
In the end, the whole project checks a dataset consisting of website reviews and use the best performing algorithms among perceptron, average perceptron and Pegasos to do a sentiment analysis or classification. Namely, whether the review is positive or negative.\
\
Key knowledge points in this small project:
- Hinge loss function
- Perceptron algorithm
- Pegasos algorithm
- Support vector machine
- Large margin classifier \
Please note, this project is one of the homework of MIT online course MITx 6.86x. So you should not simply copy the code (where #your code here is designated in project1.py and main.py) and submit it as your own answer if you are also taking this course.
